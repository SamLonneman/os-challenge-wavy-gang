## Experiment 5: Request Priority Queue

### Background
The goal of this experiment is to optimize the server such that requests are processed in order of priority using a request priority queue (implemented as a custom max heap data structure). This solution is built off of Solution_1, our first naive multithreaded solution. This solution takes it a step further, limiting the number of worker threads to the number of cores to reduce excess switching. Thus, it can also be said to draw inspiration from Solution_2, where we implemented this same concept with processes. We refer to this new solution as Solution_5, and it's code can be found on a branch called [Experiment_5](https://github.com/SamLonneman/os-challenge-wavy-gang/tree/Experiment_5). Since we expect this new solution to be a direct improvement to Solution_2, we will use Solution_2 as the baseline for this experiment. The code for Solution_2 can be found on a branch called [Experiment 2](https://github.com/SamLonneman/os-challenge-wavy-gang/tree/Experiment_2).
