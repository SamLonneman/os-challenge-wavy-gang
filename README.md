## Experiment 6: 4 Thread Multithreading

### Background 
We are taking advantage of the knowledge that there are four cores to optimize by running 4 threads concurrently. 
This builds on experiment one where we test the speed of multithreading VS multiprocesses as this experiment has also been 
emulated in a 4 process environment.
